  "heading": "Why Loopring?",

  "subtitle": "Loopring is an Ethereum Layer-2 scaling protocol. It allows anyone to build high-throughput, non-custodial AMMs and orderbook-based exchanges, and payment applications on Ethereum by leveraging Zero-Knowledge Proofs.",

    {
      "title": "Secure",
      "explain": "Loopring is an open-sourced, audited, and non-custodial exchange and payment protocol, which means nobody in the Loopring ecosystem needs to trust others. Cryptoassets are always under users' own control, with 100% Ethereum-level security guarantees."
    },
    {
      "title": "High Throughput",
      "explain": "Loopring powers highly scalable decentralized exchanges and payments by batch-processing thousands of requests off-chain, with verifiably correct execution via ZKPs. The performance of underlying Ethereum is no longer the bottleneck."
    },
    {
      "title": "Low Cost",
      "explain": "Loopring performs most operations, including order-matching and trade settlement, off the Ethereum blockchain. Such a design dramatically reduces gas consumption and thus overall settlement cost to only fractions of comparable on-chain cost."
